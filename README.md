# Trustworthy Federated Learning

> This repository is the collection of code for all related works on Trustworthy Federated Learing by FL-AIR group.
> Each folder under this repository is a set of experiments that focus on several closely related attacks. And each target to a paper published. Detail information can be found in those `README.md` files under each folder.

## 1. Folders List
| Folder | Setting | Attack | Defense | Paper|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| LabelDefender | VFL(2-party or 4-party) | Batch-level Label Inference Attack, Label Replacement Backdoor Attack | CAE, DCAE | [Defending Batch-Level Label Inference and Replacement Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/bd/5555/01/09833321/1F8uKhxrvNe) |
| [PairedLogitsInversion](https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/PairedLogitsInversion) | FL (multi-party) | Paired Logits Inversion (PLI) | - | [Breaching FedMD: Image Recovery via Paired-Logits Inversion Attack]() |

## 2. Future Updates
This folder will be updated in the future by adding more relavent code for published paper focusing on VFL privacy and safety.
